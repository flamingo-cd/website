# Introduction

Flamingo CD implements Flux as a GitOps system for ArgoCD UI. Flamingo CD supports visualization of Kubernetes and Cloud workloads via Terraform and OpenTofu.
Flamingo CD container image can be used as a drop-in replacement for the equivalent ArgoCD version to visualize, and manage Kubernetes, Terraform and OpenTofu workloads, alongside ArgoCD.
You can also ensure that upstream CVEs in Argo CD are quickly backported to Flamingo CD, maintaining a secure and stable environment.
